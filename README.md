zig zag code challenge

"paypishiring", with numRows 3 should become "pahnaplsiigyir" 

The block below shows a visual representation of the zig zag pattern, with three rows. The input string ("paypalishiring") starts in the top left, moves downward to the nth row then up and across in a diagnal path, then repeating this down and accross pattern. The output string will then be the string as it reads from left to right, top to bottom.
